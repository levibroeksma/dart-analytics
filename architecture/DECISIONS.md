# Architectural Decision Ledger

> One line per decision. This ledger is the distillation of the full design history (prompts 1–85 + dated sessions, previously stored as raw conversation logs, removed 2026-07-11). For deeper lineage consult `architecture/000_master_context.md` (historical, non-authoritative). Canonical docs always win over this ledger.

> **Source key:** P*n* = original design conversation prompt range · dates = later work sessions.

## Domain model

| # | Source | Decision | Rationale |
| - | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| D01 | P1–10 | Store what happened, derive what it means: dart-level facts are the source of all statistics | Analytics flexibility for years of progression tracking |
| D02 | P16–20 | `Activity` (why playing, resumable container) separated from `Exercise Session` (which engine, gameplay record) | Resume/interrupt semantics without polluting gameplay records |
| D03 | P16–20 | Platform framed as Exercise Execution Platform: games extensible, rulesets immutable | New games must never redesign existing ones |
| D04 | P36–40 | Runtime chain frozen: `Session → Stage → Turn → Dart`; Turn = physical oche action, Dart = atomic observation | Single event model for all game types |
| D05 | P36–40 | Generic `exercise_stages` with `stage_type_id` lookup (MATCH/SET/LEG/ROUND/EXERCISE_BLOCK), not per-game typed tables | Open/Closed extensibility without table sprawl |
| D06 | P67–71 | Dart records intention + result (`intended_*` + `hit_*` target/zone); no multiplier column; `dart_zones` lookup (6 zones) | Multiplier derivable; intention enables accuracy analytics |
| D07 | P67–71 | Recreational capture may store turn totals with no dart rows; analytics mode requires full rows | Low-friction casual play without corrupting analytics data |
| D08 | P26–30 | Participants (PLAYER/GUEST/DARTBOT) attach to exercise session, not activity | Guests/bots are per-game, not per-intent |
| D09 | Cont. session | One active session per game type per player, DB-enforced via partial unique index (migration `0011`) | Prevents orphaned active sessions |
| D10 | P36–40 | No `current_stage` pointer stored; derive from latest stage → turn → dart | No derivable state persisted |
| D11 | P21–25 | Completed gameplay immutable (application-enforced); corrections create new records; active sessions mutable during play | Historical truth; replayability |
| D12 | P59–63 | Hybrid IDs: UUIDv7 app/Worker-generated for domain entities, SMALLINT seeded for lookups; DB never generates ids | Sortable ids, deterministic seeds, no DB id coupling |
| D13 | P21–25 | Configuration chain `game_type → ruleset_version → snapshot`; runtime copies config, never FK-references templates | Template edits must not rewrite history |
| D14 | Cont. session | `configuration_templates` = JSONB preset table (migration `0010`); JSONB for preset + snapshot, application-validated, structure defined by ruleset version | Written once, read for replay, never queried relationally |
| D15 | P67–71 | Ruleset owns game limits (max darts per turn, score caps) — not DB CHECK constraints | Rules vary per ruleset version |
| D16 | P46–47 | Controlled denormalisation allowed when query-critical: `turns.total_score` + `darts.score` (app controls writes) | Measured pragmatism over purity |
| D17 | P59–63 | `display_name` lives on `players`; no separate `player_profiles` table | YAGNI for solo-operator v1 |

## Database platform & process

| # | Source | Decision | Rationale |
| - | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| D20 | P21–30 | CQRS-lite: writes to runtime tables in transactions, reads via `v_*` views only; API never exposes raw tables | Stable read contracts, schema freedom underneath |
| D21 | P48–53 | Migrations are schema-only, seeds hold controlled data; applied migrations are never modified; chain `0001`–`0016` | Auditable, reproducible schema history |
| D22 | P51–53 | Index philosophy: real query paths only, partial index for active sessions, no blind FK indexing | Write cost control |
| D23 | 2026-07-09 | dbmate owns migrations (SQL-first); `drizzle-kit introspect` provides typed query layer only — Drizzle never generates schema | Keeps SQL chain canonical while getting types |
| D24 | 2026-07-09 | Neon project in `aws-eu-central-1`, branches `main`/`preview`/`dev`; scale-to-zero on all branches for v1; shared `dev` branch for local work (no Docker Postgres) | Cost + low ops for solo operator |
| D25 | 2026-07-09 | `npx fallow` added to the standard `app/` validation sequence | Catch stale types before completion |
| D26 | 2026-07-08 | Session write idempotency table (migration `0012`) backing the batch endpoint's idempotency key | Safe client retries of batch uploads |
| D27 | 2026-07-12 | Read-model views normalized (migration `0013`): implementation keys as `*_key`, labels as `*_name`, no internal lookup ids exposed; `ruleset_version_key` added to `v_active_sessions` | Consistent, key-based read contract; fixes inconsistency the freeze missed |
| D28 | 2026-07-12 | `session_id` added to `v_dart_analytics` (migration `0014`) so `GET /sessions/:id/darts` filters by session through the view | Endpoint is per-session but the view was player-global |
| D74 | 2026-07-13 | Migration `0016` rebuilds `v_game_replay` (LEFT JOIN darts, `turn_total_score`, `stage_id`/`parent_stage_id`) and floors `v_session_overview.duration_seconds` | Recreational + nested-stage replay; integer DTO contract |

## API (v1 baseline frozen 2026-07-08)

| # | Source | Decision | Rationale |
| - | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| D30 | Cont. session | API runtime = Astro server endpoints on Cloudflare Workers in `app/` (EU) with Neon serverless driver | Latency to Neon Frankfurt; no separate Node service |
| D31 | Cont. session | Auth: Bearer JWT in `Authorization` header; middleware verifies (claims `sub`+`exp`), passes `locals.auth`; 401 for identity failures, 403 for domain authorization | Stateless, multi-client ready |
| D32 | Cont. session | Resource-first REST by domain + single batch write action `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/events:batch`; no per-dart API calls | Gameplay uploads are batches |
| D33 | P82–85 | Worker/API generates UUIDv7 for runtime persistence entities; frontend sends gameplay payloads only | Trust boundary: ids minted server-side |
| D34 | 2026-07-08 | Trusted Worker service-role DB access; PostgreSQL RLS explicitly deferred post-v1 | Single trusted writer in v1 |
| D35 | Cont. session | Standard envelope `ok/data/requestId` · `ok/error/requestId` with domain error-code registry and retryable semantics | Uniform client handling |
| D36 | 2026-07-08 | Statistics v1 scope = `GET /api/statistics/overview` only; trends/checkouts deferred (superseded by D63, 2026-07-12: overview also deferred) | Scope control |
| D37 | 2026-07-09 | Neon Auth in phase 1 with explicit `POST /api/players/provision`; DB stores `auth_user_id` reference only | Decouple identity provider from domain |
| D60 | 2026-07-12 | `POST /api/sessions` requires `captureModeKey` + `inputModeKey`; every session self-describes its capture/input mode | `exercise_sessions` NOT-NULL mode columns need an input path |
| D61 | 2026-07-12 | v1 session is single-participant (server-derived `PLAYER`); guest/DartBot deferred as additive `participants[]` | Close participant gap without multiplayer scope |
| D62 | 2026-07-12 | Provision-exempt route class: `POST /api/players/provision` is JWT-verified but skips player resolution | Endpoint must be reachable by an unprovisioned user |
| D63 | 2026-07-12 | Statistics endpoints (overview/trends/checkouts) fully deferred post-v1; each must be view-backed when built | No viewless read at freeze; acquire the data first |
| D64 | 2026-07-12 | v1 = one activity per session, server-managed; multi-session activities + routine-run writes deferred | Defer, not contradict, the activities-group-sessions model |
| D65 | 2026-07-12 | v1 API response contracts defined as camelCase Zod DTOs over the normalized views; `03`/`04` frozen at 1.0.0; read shapes corrected (`active`/`replay`/`darts` return arrays); provision endpoint returns `{ playerId, authUserId, created }` | Frozen, typed response surface for the frontend |
| D66 | 2026-07-13 | `06-API/` frozen v1: `01`/`02` frozen at 1.0.0, `03`→1.1.0; adopted `@`-prefixed aliases + `@<area>/types` type-raising barrels; removed the statistics route folder from the layering tree (statistics stay post-v1) (`03` later 1.2.0/1.3.0 under the freeze-semantics rule, 2026-07-13) | Close the API design layer with one coherent, self-consistent frozen contract before frontend work |
| D67 | 2026-07-13 | Local-first recovery: in-progress state in persisted Alpine stores (`$persist`); one batch at session completion; `clientKey` payload-internal only; no server mid-session recovery or cross-batch reconciliation. **UX (2026-07-14, D88):** auto-abandon on mismatch — no manual abandon prompt | Resolves recovery-vs-batch contradiction with zero schema cost |
| D68 | 2026-07-13 | `created_at` = row persistence time everywhere; chronology from sequence numbers + client timestamps; migration `0015` drops `chk_turn_completed_after_created` | Batch upload makes client `completedAt` predate insert |
| D69 | 2026-07-13 | Terminal statuses (COMPLETED, ABANDONED) always set `completed_at` (server default `now()`); `ACTIVE` ⇔ `completed_at IS NULL` invariant | Aligns `uq_sessions_single_active` with `v_active_sessions`; unblocks abandon flow |
| D70 | 2026-07-13 | Error registry completed with `NOT_FOUND`/`VALIDATION_FAILED`/`INVALID_STATUS_TRANSITION`/`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (only retryable code); registry closed for v1 | Registry must cover its own frozen surface |
| D71 | 2026-07-13 | `GET /api/configuration-templates` backed by `v_configuration_presets` (migration `0016`); `templateRef` = preset UUID; "no persistence UUIDs" scoped to runtime-write payloads | Game setup needs preset discovery; presets have no implementation_key by design |
| D72 | 2026-07-13 | Batch route amended to `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/events/batch` | Astro file routing serves it natively; `:batch` spelling was unservable |
| D73 | 2026-07-13 | `DartFact` intention is a nullable pair; ANALYTICS capture ⇒ intention required (service-validated); RECREATIONAL + DETAILED_DARTS = hit-only dart rows | Contract must express what the schema models |
| D75 | 2026-07-13 | Sessions list pagination orders by `session_id DESC` (UUIDv7 creation-ordered); cursor encodes last-seen `session_id` | PK doubles as pagination key; no new index |
| D76 | 2026-07-13 | Provision accepts optional `displayName`; fallback JWT `name` claim → `'Player'`; rename endpoint deferred | `players.display_name` NOT NULL needs a source at provisioning |
| D78 | 2026-07-13 | Authoritative `app/src` tree: top-level `services`/`repositories`/`db` areas; `lib/api/` = browser client (D41); `lib/server/` = envelope/error helpers | Frozen docs contradicted each other on layout |

## Frontend

| # | Source | Decision | Rationale |
| - | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| D40 | 2026-07-09 | Game engine runs client-side; frontend owns temporary state, uploads completed gameplay batches; never touches DB | Offline-tolerant play, DB owns truth |
| D41 | 2026-07-09 | Single API client (`lib/api/client.ts`), skeleton-first hydration | One integration seam |
| D77 | 2026-07-13 | `player_settings` deferred post-v1: no endpoints; `forms/` persist last-used modes and send them per D60 | Table was unreachable; local persistence covers the need |
| D79 | 2026-07-14 | Frontend handbook 0.1.0: prerender-default on Cloudflare (`output: 'server'` + per-route prerender) | Honest adapter model; fast shells |
| D80 | 2026-07-14 | Middleware protected-prefix allowlist; v1 public = `/login` only | HTML nav gate; extensible public list |
| D81 | 2026-07-14 | Alpine `app.factory` entry + `register*(Alpine)`; no `x-init`; `x-data="foo()"`; store factories invoked with `()` | Single Alpine bootstrap; init runs |
| D82 | 2026-07-14 | Alpine-native layering; pages/forms/stores orchestrate `@client/api`; modules never fetch | Testable modules; clear HTTP ownership |
| D83 | 2026-07-14 | Frontend domain at `src/` level; browser infra under `@client/`; `@utils/` for shared helpers | Agent-enforceable boundaries |
| D84 | 2026-07-14 | Suffix conventions: `.store.ts`, `.form.ts`, `.data.ts`, `.module.ts`, `.engine.module.ts`, `.payload.module.ts` | Filename encodes role |
| D85 | 2026-07-14 | OOP in `modules/` only; portable UI kit with peer-dep disclosure for Chart | Reusable primitives |
| D86 | 2026-07-14 | `$persist` in stores/forms only; timer state in game store; forms = v1 `player_settings` substitute | Predictable persistence |
| D87 | 2026-07-14 | Shared API types via Zod `z.infer<>` in `src/types/api/` with barrel raising | No DTO drift from frozen contract |
| D88 | 2026-07-14 | Client recovery: auto-abandon on mismatch/missing local; no manual abandon UI; server owns DB orphan sweeps | Amends D67 UX wording |
| D89 | 2026-07-14 | Persisted schemas additive-only in 0.1.0; no runtime schema versioning | Extend never break |

## Context & documentation system

| # | Source | Decision | Rationale |
| - | ------ | -------- | --------- |
| D50 | P31–35 | Architecture-first: docs are source of truth; implementation conflicting with docs is incorrect; targeted fixes only, never regeneration | Longevity without debt |
| D51 | Cont. session | Design-gate docs `05-Database/07`–`09` are immutable historical records with superseded-decision tables | Immutable history applies to docs too |
| D52 | 2026-07-11 | Context routing system: root `CLAUDE.md` router + `00-Context-Map.md` packs; spec split into `06-Spec/` chapters; raw conversation logs removed after distillation into this ledger; mandatory Context Maintenance protocol for every agent | Token efficiency + guaranteed context completeness |
